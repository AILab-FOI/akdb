                        AKDB system root directory consists of three folders and two files. Files contained within this
                        directory are LICENSE file (contains the GNU General Public Licence) and a README file which 
                        in short describes installation and building of the application. Folders in the root
                        directory and their purpose be explained next.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">Binary (bin)</p>

                    <p>
                        Essential folder where application compiles to and from where you can run it. Folder contains
                        several files and another folder called blobs where all binary files are stored to after running.
                        Blob folder is created empty, and is created after the application is installed and started
                        for the first time. Files in bin folder are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>akdb - </b>main executable for AKDB</li>
                            <li><b>config - </b>configuration file with default settings</li>
                            <li><b>kalasnikov - </b>database file created on first run</li>
                            <li><b>tests - </b>shell script for listing tests</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p class="bold">Documentation (doc)</p>

                    <p>
                        Documentation for AKDB is created using Doxygen. It is a tool that generates documentation
                        from comments in the source code. The end result is a reference manual in PDF format. Doxygen
                        can create this in HTML or LaTeX format.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this folder there are two additional folders. HTML folder contains HTMl and JS elements used for
                        creation of a manual in web form while LaTeX folder contains Tex elements for creation of PDF and 
                        RTF manuals. A lengthy AKDB reference manual in PDF format called <i>refman</i> is located in doc 
                        folder and it is highly recommended you study it if you want to get a better insight into the system.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">Source (src)</p>

                    <p>
                        This folder containts the main source code for compiling and building the application. It has files
                        required to start building process and subfolders where the source code files are located. Most of the
                        source code files are written in C, expect Server and SWIG files which are written in Python and shell 
                        scripts. Files in source directory:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>build - </b>cleans installation directory and compiles the application</li>
                            <li><b>doxygen - </b>configuration file with settings for Doxygen</li>
                            <li><b>main - </b>source code that starts the application and its components</li>
                            <li><b>main.d &amp; main.o - </b>dictionary and object help files</li>
                            <li><b>Makefile - </b>configuration paramaters for application building</li>
                            <li><b>projectDetails - </b>header that contains application version number</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
