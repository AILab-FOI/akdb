Kalashnikov DB

Kalashnikov DB is a simple relational database management system developed
by students of the Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Vara≈ædin,
Croatia.

The system is currently in alpha development status. If you want to compile
it to se what it does so far do:

# cd src
src/# make clean
src/# make

If everything works out then you should have a runnable binary file kdb in 
/bin and some documentation in /doc. The system requires doxygen and latex
for documentation.
