The SWIG interface is compiled by using:

=========
1. swig -python kalashnikovDB.i
2. python setup.py build_ext --inplace
=========


Afterwards you can use [fileName].py to test the interface:
Files with tests are: tablePropertiesTests.py, selectionTests.py, relAlgebraTests.py

=========
3. python [fileName].py
=========
OR 

to see doctest output, start it with:
=========
4. python -m doctest -v [fileName].py
=========

table strings needed for table correction testing are in "table_test.txt" file
