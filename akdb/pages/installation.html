                    <p>
                        Originally built for Unix based operating systems, AKDB has a pretty straightforward installation on
                        these systems. To get your AKDB going you need to simply clone the repository and install dependencies, but first
                        you need to install prerequisites:
                    </p>

                    <p class="code">
                        sudo apt-get install git build-essential swig make doxygen

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To get Kalasnikov DB you can download .zip file from GitHub on your machine or you can clone it into  
                        a directory you've positioned yourself in by using Git command:
                    </p>

                    <p class="code">
                        git clone https://github.com/mschatten/akdb
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can then change the directory to get into the structure:
                    </p>

                    <p class="code">
                        cd akdb/akdb/
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nevermind the multiple akdb directories, it was probably just a bug during migration to GitHub. In the
                        end you should end up in the root directory of the system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next thing you do is install dependencies (Python 2.7), if you don't have them already:
                    </p>

                    <p class="code">
                        sudo apt-get install python2.7
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can also set up a virtual environment for the system. To do that, install virtualenv via pip and run
                    </p>

                    <p class="code">
                        virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        into your project folder. You can do this with any Python interpreter of your choice. To use it, this
                        environment needs to be activated with "source venv/bin/activate" and deactivated with command "deactivate".
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        Windows &amp; Mac OS
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, as of this time there is no working version for Windows or Mac OS. However, you can get a
                        Docker image that enables you to run AKDB inside Docker container without the need for Linux virtual 
                        machine. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Requirements for this are <a href="www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank">Make</a>, which you have to install on your local machine. All other 
                        prerequisites will be downloaded and installed automatically. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You also need to install Docker container and this will take some time, but it allows you to develop 
                        the application in your native environment and then compile and test its code inside the container. For 
                        building AKDB in Docker container please visit <a href="build.html">Build</a> page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is also required of <u>Windows</u> users to turn on drive sharing in docker settings. 
                        To do that open docker settings, go to shared drives, check the drive on which AKDB is located and click apply.
                    </p>
