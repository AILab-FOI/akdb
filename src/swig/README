The SWIG interface is compiled by using:

=========
1. swig -python kalashnikovDB.i
2. python setup.py build_ext --inplace
=========


Afterwards you can use test.py to test the interface:
IMPORTANT:
tests are very unstable, you should probably try to start them a few times
if they throw an error.
=========
3. python test.py
gives segmentation fault (for unknown reason)
=========
OR 

to see doctest output, start it with:
=========
4. python -m doctest -v test.py
=========

table strings needed for table correction testing are in "table_test.txt" file
