\subsection{Detailed Description}
Structure that defines global redo log. 

The structure defines an array of commands being executed at the moment. If and when commands fail to execute, the rest of the commands that did not execute will be stored inside a binary file and the system will try recovery and execution for those commands. With the array, we also store a number that defines the number of commands that failed to execute (length of command\+\_\+recovery array). \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
